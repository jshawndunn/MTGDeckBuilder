When the user searches for a card, I want to grab all of the cards with a name like the search name to display to the screen.
When the user clicks on a card after a search, I want ot select that card so I can display the card options.
When the user saves a card, I want to query for all decks so I can give them choices on where to add the card.
Click create deck, grab form data, search populate DB
Click decks, grab all decks from db, display to screen
Click on deck, grab all cards associated to deck, display all cards to screen
